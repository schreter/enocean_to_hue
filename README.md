# Bridge from Enocean sensors to Philips Hue

This project provides a minimalistic bridge which understands Enocean
protocol spoken by Enocean USB300 gateway and reacts on switch presses
by setting a virtual sensor in Philips Hue bridge to a specified value.
This way, it is possible to integrate for instance Eltako switches to
control Philips Hue lightning system.
